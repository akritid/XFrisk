		o Mouse movement over a country displays name and continent.
		o Add assertions for RISK_Get*Of[Country|Player]!!
		o Man page!
		o Have a larger version (not 800x600)
		o Missions.  Abstract concept of "Game Over" so this is easy.
		o Make font handling nice if it can't find first choice.

Long Term Goals (v2.0)
======================

	o Rewrite in C++
	o Aesthetic value (write my own widgets, sort of NeXTish, using
	  primitives that can be mapped to Win32/X).
	o GA or GP computer player
	o Drag'n Drop for armies like MAC Risk (from dice window)
	o Maintain bug level to near zero.
	o Port to Windows95
	o Menu bar
	o Undo (Infinite, of course)
	o GUI for server
	o Make the game part more separate from GUI/Network, then implement
	  a few other games over this: Scrabble (Rabble) and Monopoly.  Try
	  not to get sued.


SERVER (for future):
====================
	o Meta-server (which lets people download newest version 
	  automatically).
	o In case a player doesn't reconnect after disappearing, assign
	  a computer player to continue the game.
	o Make it so that client allocation is handled the same way as
	  player allocation.
	o Let newly joined clients take over for dead players, or perhaps
	  also let already existing players take over (In general, this
	  is allowing Player Migration).
		
CLIENT (in future):
===================
	o Have better support for atomic message passing (transactions).
	  For example, ATOMIC stream of messages, or just define some atomic
	  operations that correspond to one or more primitives (i.e.
	  ALLOC_PLAYER, PLACE_ARMIES, etc...)
	o Incorporate message ID into message itself.
	o Make some network operations more like transactions, 
	  for example MSG_MOVE, MSG_ATTACK, etc. -- perhaps composed
	  of multiple dist. obj. primitive messages.
	o Have _NET_* return Frisk error codes (instead of "... failed").
	o Have non-debugging malloc check for NULL pointers.
	o Add srandom() calls.
	o Improve message set to reduce bandwidth (a PlaceArmy action takes
	  4 messages currently, and there is overlap).
	o Icon for the game (tiny world map?)
	o Acknowlege the world gif??
	o Clean code up and add function explanations!!!
	o Limit size of buttons in Popup dialog, center them.
	o Fix so that 1 bit X servers work.
	o NET_GetStatistics for stats on bytes tx/rx.
	o Use intro fonts for end of game message.
	o Update the MSG_TURNNOTIFY message to just take the player.
	o Choosing defense die?
	o Display values of the continents.
