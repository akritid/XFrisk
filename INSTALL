0.  YOU NEED AN ANSI C COMPILER!  A C++ compiler may also work (try it!)  
    XFrisk will eventually be rewritten in C++ anyway :) POSIX compliance 
    would probably help.


1.  Edit the Makefile to suit your system and taste. Imake is no
    longer used. GNU autoconf might be used in the future.

    NOTE: XFrisk is forgiving. If it can't find its data files, it
    looks in the current directory. So if you're just trying XFrisk
    out, you can just type `make' to get fully working binaries
    without any need for root privilege or installing anything.


2.  Compile. Type `make'. If that bombs, try `gmake'. If that bombs,
    edit the Makefile and take out the line that says
    "include depend.mk", do `make types.h', and then try again.
    
    More make options:
	-make friskserver
        	to compile only server
        -make ai
        	to compile ai's
        -make uninstall
        	will try to uninstall the installed file. 
                this will of course only work if you don't change 
                PREFIX in Makefile

    Then install with `make install'.
    

3.  Try it out by running `friskserver' and then `xfrisk <host>.'  You can run
    the former in the background if you wish.  For <host>, put in the name 
    of the machine on which the server is running.  For example, if both
    are running on the same machine, then type:

	> friskserver &
	> xfrisk 127.0.0.1

    Or if the last command fails, try:

	> xfrisk localhost

    Or you can just run the `risk' script, which does this for you.  It uses
    localhost.  If 127.0.0.1 works for you, then edit the script and change
    it.  If both localhost and 127.0.0.1 (loopback device) fail for you, 
    try the actual name of your machine (you can do this through
        > xfrisk `hostname`
    which you can also put in the script).


4.  Enjoy it!
