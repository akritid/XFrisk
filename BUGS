o Sometimes the card list seems to get corrupted, which results in an
  infinite stream of dialogs saying "Bogus request to CARD_RenderCard"
  and trashes the game in progress. One time some wrong country counts
  were observed in the stats window shortly before hand, but this may
  not be related.

o Sometimes if you remove a player and add a new one, particularly if
  the old player had played in a game already, it doesn't fully go away,
  and your messages get reported as coming from it instead of you. 

o Should report FQDNs of people connecting. Should also be able to 
  work out who people are during a game.

o If you kill somebody off and end up with more than 9 cards (so you'd
  need to exchange two sets to get to 5 or under) it doesn't let you,
  and then you end up with six cards and things go rapidly downhill as
  you exchange cards during other people's turns.

  (Later note: this situation came up for me recently and didn't break
  things, so maybe the problem went away or only occurs some of the time.)

o Focus gets grabbed by Frisk when adding a player after popping down
  color editing box.

o Focus doesn't always get set right for the armies popup.  Doesn't get set
  from main window to armies.

o Two computers playing against each other dying doesn't restart the
  game -- server bug?

o Clients appearing after a new species registers are not notified of
  the species.
