0. WHAT DOES "Error: Widget wDiceBox has zero width and/or height" MEAN?
 
   See question 1, the same solution applies.  IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN AS OF
   0.99b3, WHICH HAS DEFAULT RESOURCES!
  
1. WHY IS MY DISPLAY ALL SCREWED UP/HOSED/POKED?

   Is the app resource file XFrisk.ad installed in the right place?  You
   can change the XAPPLRESDIR environment variable to check in the current
   directory by typing something like:

	setenv XAPPLRESDIR /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults:./

   IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN AS OF 0.99b3, WHICH HAS DEFAULT RESOURCES!

2. I CAN'T GET XFRISK TO START.  WHY?

   If XFrisk is unable to find some of its files, "make install" again
   in the XFrisk source directory to reinstall the data files and programs.

3. HOW DO I START A MULTICLIENT GAME?

   In order to set up a multiclient game, run friskserver on one
   machine, and then run the clients on the remote machines as follows:

	kashmir > friskserver &
	...
	silk > xfrisk kashmir &
	...
	cotton > xfrisk kashmir &

   Clients may register players while the other clients join. The game
   starts when all clients that have registered players have pressed
   the start button (be careful about this, you might accidentally leave
   out someone who is still registering a player or just connecting!).
   Clients can connect at any time during a game to watch it, and
   register players after the game has ended.

   Also note: there can be more than one human player on the same client.

4. WHAT ABOUT COMPUTER PLAYERS?

   Computer players come as separate clients, named eg. aiColson
   and aiConway. They get installed with the rest of the package in the
   same directory as the xfrisk and friskserver binaries (BINDIR in
   Makefile).

   Once you have a server running, you need to connect them like this
   (assuming you are running the server on your local system):

	aiColson localhost &

   When you select Add Player, you should see multiple entries in the 
   Species box. Select a non-Human one (Ordinateur for aiColson), and
   edit player info normally. You now have a computer player in your game.
   You can add more than one AI species by repeating the above procedure
   with another AI client program. Also note that once an AI species is
   registered in the game anyone connecting to the server can add AI
   players to the game. Anyone can also remove them.

5. IT SAYS "Assertion Failure" AND THEN DUMPS CORE.  WHAT DO I DO?

   In general, whenever you get a core dump, it would be greatly 
   appreciated if you sent details to the developers -- it will result
   in a more robust game for you. In order to send info, run a debugger
   on the core file as follows (stuff in [] are comments):
	
	$ dbx [or gdb] server [or client] core  
	dbx> where
		
   If you send the output of the "where", along with a description of how
   it happened, then we'll probably have a fix ready within a few days
   N.B.  You have to have compiled XFrisk with debugging in, see
   question 8.

6. I AM FROM PARKER BROTHER AND WANT TO SUE YOU.  WHAT DO I DO?

   Yo no hablo ingles...
	Sue not here!

7. IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN BUILD FRISK WITH MORE DEBUGGING INFORMATION?

   Yes.  Look in Makefile, and leave the developer's CDEBUGFLAGS 
   uncommented.  Then remake XFrisk.

8. HOW CAN I HELP?

   If you find a bug you can send us a bug report.  Patches that improve
   the game will be considered also, based upon their quality and 
   desirability.  Patches that are included will be credited. You can
   find contact information for sending patches on the XFrisk website
   (see next question).
